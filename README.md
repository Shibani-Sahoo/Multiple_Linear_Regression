# Multiple Linear Regression on USA Housing Dataset  

## 📄 Project Overview  
This project involves predicting house prices using **Multiple Linear Regression**, a fundamental statistical technique used in machine learning. The dataset contains features such as income levels, population, and house characteristics, providing insights into the factors influencing housing prices.

## 🔍 What is Multiple Linear Regression?  
Multiple Linear Regression is an extension of **Simple Linear Regression**, where the model predicts the value of a dependent variable based on multiple independent variables. It models the relationship between these variables by fitting a hyperplane in the n-dimensional space.  

### **Mathematical Equation:**  
\[
y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + ... + b_nx_n
\]  

Where:  
- **y**: Target (dependent) variable  
- **x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ**: Independent (predictor) variables  
- **b₀**: Intercept (value of y when all x's are 0)  
- **b₁, b₂, ..., bₙ**: Coefficients (how much y changes for a unit change in x)

## ⚙️ How It Works  
### **1. Data Preparation:**  
- Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing outliers, and scaling features if needed.  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize relationships between variables.  

### **2. Model Training:**  
- Fit the Multiple Linear Regression model by finding the best coefficients using the **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** method.  
- OLS minimizes the sum of the squared errors between actual and predicted values.  

### **3. Prediction:**  
- Use the regression equation to make predictions for unseen data.  

### **4. Evaluation:**  
Evaluate model performance using statistical metrics such as:  
- **R² Score:** Measures the proportion of variance explained by the model. A higher value indicates a better fit.  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.

## 📑 Key Assumptions of Multiple Linear Regression  
1. **Linearity:** The relationship between dependent and independent variables is linear.  
2. **Independence:** Residuals are independent of each other.  
3. **Homoscedasticity:** The variance of residuals is constant across all values of independent variables.  
4. **Normality of Errors:** Residuals should follow a normal distribution.  
5. **No Multicollinearity:** Independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other.
